## Motivation to build this website
After seeing some parts of CS50w course video, I just want to apply my skill to 
build a real and functional website. At this moment, I saw a video that is 
about studying method. However, using mobile phone's build-in timer is not 
convenient enough, so I decided to build the app that can record your time usage.
Initially, I plan to earn money by putting ads on the website, but
it's not an easy goal. After some tries, I changed my mind and decided to 
publish on my Github. Sorry to those who want to see the code because the 
code are really messy!
